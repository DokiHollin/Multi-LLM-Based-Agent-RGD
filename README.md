This repository include code and dataset for the paper **RGD: Multi-LLM Based Agent Debugger via Refinement and Generation Guidance** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01242)

The **RGD** framework is a multi-LLM-based agent debugger that leverages three distinct LLM agentsâ€”Guide Agent, Debug Agent, and Feedback Agent. RGD decomposes the code generation task into multiple steps, ensuring a clearer workflow and enabling iterative code refinement based on self reflection and feedback. 

# CODE WILL BE RELEASED AFTER CONFERENCE DATE
