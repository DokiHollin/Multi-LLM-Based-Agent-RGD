{"task_id": "HumanEval/32", "guides": "Certainly! Let's break down the task and approach it step-by-step.\n\n### Task Breakdown\n\n1. **Understanding the Function `poly`:** \n   - This function evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x`.\n   - The polynomial is defined by a list of coefficients `xs` where:\n     - `xs[0]` is the constant term,\n     - `xs[1]` is the coefficient for `x`,\n     - `xs[2]` is the coefficient for `x^2`, and so on.\n   - The function uses `math.pow(x, i)` to compute `x^i` for each term.\n\n2. **Understanding the Function `find_zero`:**\n   - This function attempts to find a root of the polynomial described by the coefficients in `xs`.\n   - It specifically requires that `xs` has an even number of coefficients and that the largest non-zero coefficient is present to guarantee a solution.\n\n### Approach to Solve the Task\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze Polynomial Properties\n- **Polynomial Structure:** Ensure you understand how polynomials behave. For instance, knowing that a linear polynomial (e.g., ax + b) has at most one root, while a quadratic (ax^2 + bx + c) has up to two roots, etc.\n- **Root Existence:** The task assumes that a root exists due to the even number of coefficients and the largest coefficient condition. This might imply that the polynomial can be factored in a way that ensures at least one real root.\n\n#### Step 2: Root-Finding Techniques\n- **Analytical Methods:** For polynomials of degree 1 or 2, you can use analytical methods like:\n  - **Linear:** Solve `ax + b = 0` to find `x = -b/a`.\n  - **Quadratic:** Use the quadratic formula `x = (-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)` for `ax^2 + bx + c`.\n- **Numerical Methods:** For higher-degree polynomials:\n  - **Newton's Method:** An iterative method that can converge to a root if a good initial guess is chosen.\n  - **Bisection Method:** A robust method that requires finding an interval `[a, b]` where the polynomial changes sign, implying a root exists within the interval.\n\n#### Step 3: Implement the Solution\n- **Iterative Approach:** Consider implementing an iterative method if the degree of the polynomial is greater than 2. Initialize with a guess and refine it using one of the numerical methods.\n- **Handling Edge Cases:** Ensure your method handles cases where the polynomial is constant (e.g., `f(x) = c`), as these won't have roots unless `c = 0`.\n\n#### Step 4: Testing and Validation\n- **Test with Known Roots:** Use the provided examples and additional test cases where the roots are known to validate your implementation.\n- **Edge Cases:** Test with polynomials that have multiple roots, no real roots, and very small/large coefficients to ensure robustness.\n\n### Additional Advice\n- **Precision:** Consider the precision of floating-point calculations, especially when dealing with numerical methods.\n- **Complex Roots:** The task focuses on real roots, but be aware that some polynomials may have complex roots. Ensure your method can distinguish or handle these appropriately.\n- **Performance Considerations:** Numerical methods can be computationally expensive, so optimize your algorithm for performance if necessary.\n\nBy following these steps and considerations, you'll be able to implement a function that finds a zero of the given polynomial accurately and efficiently.", "description": "Create a function to evaluate polynomials and find their zero points.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/54", "guides": "To solve the problem of checking if two strings have the same characters, you can follow a structured approach. The aim is to determine if the set of unique characters present in both strings are identical. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you tackle this problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - You are given two strings, `s0` and `s1`.\n   - You need to check if both strings contain exactly the same set of unique characters, regardless of their frequency or order.\n\n2. **Examples and Edge Cases:**\n   - Analyze the provided examples to understand the expected outcomes.\n   - Consider edge cases such as empty strings or strings with different lengths.\n\n3. **Use Sets to Identify Unique Characters:**\n   - **Set Data Structure:** Utilize Python's `set` data structure to extract unique characters from each string. A set automatically handles duplicate elements by only storing unique items.\n   - For example, converting the string `'eabcdzzzz'` to a set will yield `{'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z'}`.\n\n4. **Compare the Sets:**\n   - Once you have converted both strings to sets of characters, compare these sets.\n   - If the sets are equal, it means both strings contain the same unique characters.\n\n5. **Implementation Steps:**\n   - Convert `s0` to a set of characters, say `set_s0`.\n   - Convert `s1` to a set of characters, say `set_s1`.\n   - Check if `set_s0` is equal to `set_s1`.\n\n6. **Return the Result:**\n   - If the sets are equal, return `True`.\n   - If the sets are not equal, return `False`.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Efficiency:** The conversion of a string to a set and the comparison of two sets are both efficient operations. This approach should work well for reasonably sized strings.\n  \n- **Case Sensitivity:** Ensure you understand whether the problem is case-sensitive or not. If it's not specified, ask for clarification or make an assumption and document it. If case insensitivity is required, consider converting both strings to the same case (either upper or lower) before creating sets.\n\n- **Empty Strings:** Handle cases where one or both strings might be empty. According to the problem, two empty strings should return `True` since they trivially contain the same set of characters (none).\n\n- **Testing:** After implementing your solution, test it against various cases including:\n  - Strings with varying lengths.\n  - Strings with no common characters.\n  - Strings where one is a subset of the other.\n  - Strings that are permutations of one another.\n\nBy following this guide, you should be able to solve the task efficiently and ensure that your solution is robust and handles various scenarios correctly.", "description": "Create a function `same_chars` that determines if two input strings contain the same set of characters, regardless of the quantity of each character.

If it is, the first character of the string will be '-'.\n     - Extract the first digit and treat it as negative, then process the rest as positive.\n     - For positive numbers, simply sum the numerical values of all digits.\n\n3. **Check the Sum of Digits**:\n   - After calculating the sum of the digits for a number, check if it is greater than zero.\n   - If the sum is greater than zero, increment a counter that tracks how many numbers meet this condition.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - Once you have processed all the numbers in the array, return the counter as the result.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\n- For `count_nums([-1, 11, -11])`:\n  - `-1`: The sum of digits is -1, which is not greater than 0.\n  - `11`: The sum of digits is 1 + 1 = 2, which is greater than 0.\n  - `-11`: The sum of digits is -1 + 1 = 0, which is not greater than 0.\n  - Only one number (`11`) has a sum of digits greater than 0, so the output is 1.\n\n- For `count_nums([1, 1, 2])`:\n  - Each number has a positive sum of digits (1, 1, and 2 respectively), thus the output is 3.\n\n### Edge Cases\n- **Empty Array**: Should return 0 as there are no numbers to process.\n- **All Negative Numbers**: Consider examples like all small negative numbers (e.g., `[-1, -2, -3]`) where sums could be negative.\n- **Mixed Positive and Negative**: Ensure the function handles a mix of both signs correctly.\n\n### Tips\n\n- **String Conversion**: Use string conversion to easily iterate over digits.\n- **Negative Handling**: Pay special attention to negative numbers.

These intervals are inclusive, meaning they include both the start and end points.\n\n2. **Intersection of Intervals:** The intersection of two intervals is the range of numbers that both intervals cover. If there is no overlap, the intersection is empty.\n\n3. **Prime Number Check:** A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Typically, the dictionary might have words as keys and their occurrences as values, but you should verify this with whoever provided the task.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Output Requirements\n- **Output Description**: The task is to count the most common words, which implies determining the word or words that appear the most frequently.\n- You might need to decide whether to return just the most common word, all words with the highest frequency, or a count of how many times the most common word appears.\n\n### Step 3: Plan the Solution\n1. **Extract and Analyze Data**:\n   - Extract the keys (words) and their corresponding values (counts) from the dictionary.\n   - Determine the highest frequency by iterating through the dictionary values.\n\n2. **Identify the Most Common Words**:\n   - Find the word(s) that have the maximum frequency. You may need to iterate through the dictionary again to collect all words with this frequency.\n\n3. **Output the Result**:\n   - Decide the format of the output based on the requirements (e.g., a list of words, a single word, or the frequency count).\n\n### Step 4: Handle Edge Cases\n- **Empty Dictionary**: Consider what should happen if the input dictionary is empty. Should the function return an empty list, zero, or raise an error?\n- **All Unique Words**: If all words have the same frequency, decide how to handle this situation. Should all be returned?\n- **Invalid Input**: Consider whether you need to handle cases where the input is not a dictionary.\n\n### Step 5: Optimize the Approach\n- While counting words, ensure you efficiently traverse the dictionary. Python's built-in functions and data structures can help in achieving this efficiently.\n- Consider the time complexity. Since you will likely traverse the dictionary at least once, the solution should be linear with respect to the number of entries.\n\n### Step 6: Testing\n- **Test Cases**:\n  - Test with a dictionary containing one word.\n  - Test with multiple words having different frequencies.\n  - Test with multiple words having the same highest frequency.\n  - Test with an empty dictionary.\n  - Test with large datasets to ensure performance.\n\n### Step 7: Document the Function\n- Add a clear docstring explaining the function's purpose, inputs, outputs, and any exceptions it might raise.\n\n### Additional Advice\n- Use Python's built-in functions and data structures such as `collections.Counter` if appropriate, as they can simplify the task of counting frequencies.\n- Write clean and readable code by using descriptive variable names and comments where necessary.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can methodically tackle the task of counting the most common words in a dictionary.", "description": "Create a function named `count_common` that takes a dictionary as its parameter, where each key is a word and its corresponding value is the word's frequency.

This can be achieved by slicing the string from the start to the first lowercase, from each lowercase to the next, and so on.\n\n5. **Handle Edge Cases**:\n   - Consider what should happen if the string starts with a lowercase letter, ends with a lowercase letter, or contains consecutive lowercase letters.

This means:\n- You need to identify which elements in the array are repeated.\n- Once identified, sum these repeated elements.\n\n### Step 2: Consider Edge Cases\nBefore diving into the implementation, think about some edge cases:\n- What if the array is empty?\n- What if no elements are repeated?\n- What if all elements are the same?\n- What if the array contains negative numbers or zeros?\n\n### Step 3: Plan Your Approach\n1. **Count Elements**: Use a data structure to keep track of the number of occurrences of each element in the array.

Each element in `input_list` is itself a list.\n2. **Output**: You need to return the list (from the input) that has the smallest number of elements.\n\n### Plan\n1. **Clarify Requirements**:\n   - You are asked to use a lambda function. This suggests using Python's functional programming tools, like `min()` with a `key` parameter that takes a lambda function.\n\n2. **Identify Key Functionality**:\n   - **Lambda Function**: This is an anonymous function that can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. For this task, the lambda function should return the length of a list.\n   - **min() Function**: This built-in Python function returns the smallest item from an iterable. It can take an optional `key` argument, which is a function that extracts a comparison key from each element in the iterable.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Use the `min()` function to evaluate which list in your `input_list` has the smallest length.\n   - Utilize a lambda function to provide the `key` for comparison in the `min()` function. The lambda should take a single parameter (each sublist) and return its length using the `len()` function.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n1. **Define the Function**:\n   - Start by defining your function `min_length_list(input_list)`.\n\n2. **Use the `min()` Function with a Lambda**:\n   - Call `min()` on `input_list`.\n   - Set the `key` argument of `min()` to a lambda function that returns the length of each list, i.e., `lambda x: len(x)`.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - The `min()` function will return the list with the smallest length based on the key provided (length of the lists).\n\n### Edge Cases to Consider\n- **Empty `input_list`**: Decide what should happen if the input list is empty. You might want to return `None` or raise an exception.\n- **Lists with Equal Lengths**: If two or more lists have the same minimum length, `min()` will return the first one it encounters.\n- **Single Element Lists**: If the `input_list` contains lists with only one element, make sure the function handles them correctly.\n- **Mixed Data Types**: Ensure all elements in `input_list` are indeed lists to avoid unexpected errors.\n\n### Testing the Solution\n- Test your function with different scenarios:\n  - A list of lists with varying lengths.\n  - A list with all lists of the same length.\n  - An empty `input_list`.\n  - A large number of lists to check performance.\n\nBy following this guide, you should be able to implement the `min_length_list` function effectively, utilizing lambda functions and Python's powerful built-in tools to achieve the desired outcome.", "description": "Create a function, `min_length_list`, that identifies the list with the minimum length from a given list of lists.

Let's break down the approach to solving this problem:\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Definitions:**\n   - A **list** is an ordered collection of items.\n   - A **sublist** is a contiguous sequence of elements from a list. For example, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the sequences `[2, 3]` and `[3, 4]` are sublists.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - You need to determine if a list `l` contains a sequence of elements that matches another list `s` (the sublist).\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Consider what should happen if the sublist `s` is empty. By definition, an empty sublist is considered to be contained within any list.\n   - If the main list `l` is empty but `s` is not, then `s` cannot be contained within `l`.\n\n2. **Iterative Approach:**\n   - You can iterate over the main list `l` and check if the elements from the current position match the sequence in `s`.\n   - For each position `i` in `l`, check if the slice `l[i:i+len(s)]` is equal to `s`.\n   - If you find a match, you can immediately return `True`.\n   - If you finish the loop without finding a match, return `False`.\n\n3. **Efficiency Considerations:**\n   - The time complexity of this approach is O(n * m), where `n` is the length of `l` and `m` is the length of `s`. This is because, in the worst case, you might need to check every possible starting position in `l` up to `len(l) - len(s) + 1`.\n\n4. **Alternative Methods:**\n   - **String Conversion:**\n     - Convert both lists to strings and check for substring presence.

{"task_id": "MBPP/71", "guides": "Certainly! Comb sort is an interesting sorting algorithm that improves upon the bubble sort by using a gap sequence. It's quite efficient and easy to understand once you grasp the basic concept. Let's break down the steps to implement comb sort.\n\n### Understanding Comb Sort\n\n1. **Concept**:\n   - Comb sort is a variation of the bubble sort.\n   - The key idea is to eliminate small values near the end of the list, which bubble sort does inefficiently.\n   - It does so by introducing a \"gap\" that allows for larger jumps in comparisons and swaps.\n\n2. **Gap Sequence**:\n   - Start with a gap equal to the length of the list divided by a shrink factor, typically 1.3.\n   - After each pass, reduce the gap by dividing it by the shrink factor.\n   - Continue this process until the gap reduces to 1, at which point it becomes a regular bubble sort.\n\n3. **Algorithm Steps**:\n   - Initialize the gap as the length of the list.\n   - While the gap is greater than 1:\n     - Divide the gap by the shrink factor and update it to an integer value.\n     - Compare elements that are `gap` indices apart.\n     - Swap them if they are in the wrong order.\n     - Keep track of whether any swaps were made.\n   - If no swaps are made during a complete pass with `gap = 1`, the list is sorted.\n\n### Detailed Implementation Guide\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Start by determining the initial gap value, which is the length of the list.\n   - Choose a shrink factor. The value 1.3 is often used.\n\n2. **Main Loop**:\n   - Use a loop to iterate while the gap is greater than 1 or swaps are still being made.\n   - In each iteration, update the gap by dividing it by the shrink factor and converting it to an integer.\n\n3. **Inner Loop for Comparison and Swaps**:\n   - Iterate through the list, comparing elements that are `gap` positions apart.\n   - If the element at the higher index is less than the one at the lower index, swap them.\n   - Set a flag if any swaps are made, indicating that sorting is not yet complete.\n\n4. **Final Pass with Gap = 1**:\n   - Once the gap reduces to 1, perform a final pass to ensure the list is completely sorted.\n   - This step effectively becomes a bubble sort pass.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - An empty list or a list with one element is already sorted.\n   - Consider lists with duplicate elements to ensure they are handled correctly.\n\n### Testing\n\n- Test the function with various lists, including:\n  - Already sorted lists.\n  - Reverse sorted lists.\n  - Lists with duplicate elements.\n  - Lists with a single element or empty lists.\n\n### Optimization Considerations\n\n- Although comb sort is an improvement over bubble sort, it's not as efficient as more advanced algorithms like quicksort or mergesort for large datasets.\n- Its average and worst-case time complexity is O(n^2/2^p), where p is the number of increments, making it faster than bubble sort but slower than more advanced algorithms.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to implement the comb sort algorithm effectively!", "description": "Create a function named `comb_sort` that takes a list, `nums`, as input and sorts it using the comb sort algorithm.

The description mentions \"adding all the characters,\" which suggests that we might be dealing with some kind of numerical computation involving characters.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Clarify \"Adding Characters\":**\n   - Characters in Python can be converted to their ASCII numerical values using the `ord()` function. For instance, `ord('A')` returns `65`.\n   - Conversely, `chr()` can convert a number back to a character, e.g., `chr(65)` returns `'A'`.\n\n2. **Convert Characters to Numerical Values:**\n   - Iterate over each character in the string.\n   - Use `ord()` to get the ASCII value of each character.\n\n3. **Sum the Numerical Values:**\n   - Accumulate the sum of these ASCII values. This effectively represents the \"adding\" of characters.\n\n4. **Convert the Sum Back to a Character:**\n   - Use `chr()` to convert the resulting sum back into a character. This step assumes that the sum corresponds to a valid character in the Unicode range.\n\n5. **Handle Edge Cases:**\n   - Consider what should happen if the string is empty. Typically, you might return an empty string or a specific default character.\n   - Consider what should happen if the sum goes beyond the typical ASCII range (0-127).

Given that `k` is likely 1-based (the 1st element is at index 1 in traditional terminology), you'll need to adjust `k` by subtracting 1 to access the correct index in the array.\n\n### Step 4: Access the Element\nOnce you have converted `k` to a zero-based index, accessing the kth element is straightforward:\n- Ensure that `k-1` is within the bounds of the list indices.\n- If it is, return the element at that index.\n- If not, handle the case appropriately (e.g., raise an error or return a specific value).\n\n### Step 5: Implement Error Handling\nDecide how you want to handle invalid `k` values:\n- Return `None` or a specific error message.\n- Raise an `IndexError` or a custom exception.\n- Consider what makes sense in the context of your application or assignment.\n\n### Step 6: Testing\nCreate a set of test cases to validate your solution:\n- Regular cases: arrays of various sizes with valid `k`.\n- Edge cases: `k = 1`, `k = n`, `k` greater than `n`, `k` less than 1.\n- Special cases: empty array, single-element array.\n\n### Step 7: Optimize (If Necessary)\nFor this problem, optimization isn't a major concern since accessing an element by index is O(1) in Python. However, ensure that your error handling doesn't introduce unnecessary complexity.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- Always check the constraints of the problem (e.g., maximum size of `n`) to tailor your solution to potential performance requirements.\n- If `arr` is sorted or has special properties, note whether this affects your approach, though for this task, it's mainly about index access.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to write a robust solution to find the kth element in an array.", "description": "Create a function named `kth_element` that takes three parameters: a list `arr`, an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list, and an integer `k`.

{"task_id": "MBPP/108", "guides": "To solve the task of merging multiple sorted lists into a single sorted iterator using the heap queue algorithm, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - You are given three sorted lists: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.\n   - Your goal is to merge these lists into a single iterator that yields elements in sorted order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize the Solution:**\n   - When merging sorted lists, we need to maintain the sorted order in the final output.\n   - The heap queue algorithm (often implemented using a min-heap) is well-suited for this task because it allows efficient retrieval of the smallest element from multiple lists.\n\n3. **Heap Queue Basics:**\n   - A min-heap is a binary tree where the parent node is always less than or equal to the child nodes.\n   - Python provides the `heapq` module, which supports heap operations like `heappush` (to add elements) and `heappop` (to remove the smallest element).\n\n4. **Using `heapq.merge`:**\n   - Python's `heapq` module offers a `merge` function that can merge multiple sorted inputs into a single sorted iterator.\n   - This function efficiently handles the merging process using a heap data structure internally.\n\n5. **Plan the Implementation:**\n   - Ensure the function signature is `def merge_sorted_list(num1, num2, num3):`.\n   - Utilize `heapq.merge` to combine `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` into a single iterator.\n   - Return the iterator from the function.\n\n6. **Efficiency Considerations:**\n   - The `heapq.merge` function is designed to be memory efficient; it doesn't require loading all elements into memory at once.\n   - It operates in O(N log k) time complexity, where N is the total number of elements across all lists and k is the number of lists.\n\n7. **Testing the Solution:**\n   - Test with lists of different lengths and varying values to ensure correct merging.\n   - Verify that the function can handle edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with duplicate values.\n   - Check that the returned iterator yields elements in the expected order.\n\n8. **Iterators and Generators:**\n   - Remember that `heapq.merge` returns an iterator, which is a type of generator.\n   - This means elements are produced on-the-fly, which is beneficial for large data sets.\n\n### Additional Advice:\n\n- **Documentation and Comments:**\n  - Include meaningful comments in your code to explain the logic and usage of the `heapq.merge` function.\n  - Use docstrings to document the functionâs purpose, inputs, and outputs.\n\n- **Edge Cases and Error Handling:**\n  - Consider adding checks or handling for invalid inputs, such as non-list arguments.\n  - Ensure your implementation gracefully handles scenarios where one or more inputs are empty.\n\nBy following these steps and considerations, you can effectively implement a function to merge multiple sorted lists using a heap-based approach. This method leverages Python's built-in capabilities to provide an efficient and elegant solution.", "description": "Create a function `merge_sorted_list(num1, num2, num3)` that merges three sorted input lists into a single sorted iterator.
